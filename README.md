This repository demonstrates a common error in older PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions.  These functions are no longer supported and cause errors in modern PHP versions. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using the MySQLi or PDO extensions.  It's crucial to update your code to avoid these errors and leverage more secure and efficient database interaction methods.
